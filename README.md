# `lmaos`
`lmaos` is a package manager for software, supported by Windows and Unix-like systems. ~~This is a feat in package manager history, since package managers rarely support Windows \/j~~

## Build

**Prerequisites**:
  - the GCC compiler

If you're on Windows, you can try using `build` or `build.bat` in a Terminal. If neither works, last resort would be running the command from Windows Explorer.

On Linux or other Unix-like systems, use `./build.sh`. If this doesn't work, ~~try doing a `chmod +x ./build.sh` before trying again~~ (fixed in [`743ef53`](https://github.com/lmaosofts/lmaos/commit/743ef53)).

The build command should automatically run `lmaos`, demonstrating the package manager in all it's beauty.

## Recommended terminal apps

For Windows I mainly test `lmaos` in Windows Terminal. For Linux users, I'm sure your default terminal will work fine.

## How to use?

Summon the help text by running `lmaos` with no args.
